<p class="headline">Our Family Still Exists</p>
<p class="articlesubheadings">Fifteen Years Later</p>

<p class="Montserrat-ThinItalic">This is not the Reich Family's official website. This site serves as an introduction to the Reich Family from a different perspective. This article was written by Reich, the leader of the family. To learn more about us, please visit the <a href="https://reich.tf" target="_blank"><b>Reich Family</b></a> official website.</p>

<p>In 2010, a nineteen year old San Francisco girl interviewed with mainstream media for two months stating that I was the leader of a sex cult. Her account was filled with stories of the sexual abuse of little girls and a death squad that would kill on my command. My family is diametrically opposed to every aspect of that accusation which was made by a person who was never a member of our family and was never in our presence to witness a single thing she accused our family of doing. The very notion that we sexually abuse our children is repulsive to us and violates everything that we stand for and believe in. Our children and teens are highly valued and protected. Our focus is not on little girls, teenage girls, or any one member or small group in our family. Each member of our family is equally valued, loved, and respected.</p>

<p>In the 2010 attack, my family and I were compared in the media to Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple as well as Charles Manson and the Manson Family. I have gone into great depth about Jim Jones and his followers in the article <a href="https://johnmarkkarr.com/thefamily" target="_blank">Tale of Two Cults</a>. Over 930 people followed Jim Jones to the ends of the earth. This included 909 members who died in Jonestown; 4 members who died at the house in Georgetown; 14 members who defected that day, with one being killed; and members Tim Carter, Mike Carter, and Mike Prokes who were apprehended by authorities that day. There were various defectors over the years. Prior to that fateful day on November 18th 1978, 930 people were convinced they should live in a remote jungle in Guyana South America to be with Jim Jones and fellow members of the Peoples Temple family. They proved they would do anything or sacrifice anything for their leader.</p>

<p>His response to their loyalty was abuse, deprivation, near starvation, and their ultimate deaths. How he could bring harm to such precious souls who looked up to him and called him Dad, I will never understand. Having witnessed the atrocities of Jonestown, any leader of a similar family should never wish to make the same mistakes Jones made. What happened in Jonestown should bring any good and decent leader closer to his own family, with a renewed pledge to love them more, to appreciate them more, and to give them everything that is good. Our family denounces Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple as well as Charles Manson and the Manson Family. We guard against the religious extremism and leader worship that killed the members of Jim Jones' religious group. We have studied the lives and deaths of Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple and have learned from every terrible mistake that was made.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:-20px;">My family does not worship me as their God. They respect me as their leader. My family does not fear me because I would never bring harm to them. My family does not feel disappointment or doubt in me because I never deprive them of what they so richly deserve. I have earned my family's respect, love, loyalty, and trust by working hard every day to make their lives better. Our family lives a covert life, not because we have something to hide, but because we must protect ourselves from another attack such as the one in 2010. We have a right to privately live our lives in a beautiful and peaceful place. Your attempt to destroy our family in 2010 was unsuccessful. Fifteen years later, we still exist.
